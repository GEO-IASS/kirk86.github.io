excerpt: A short description of the fundamental theorem of algebra.

<p>
The <b>fundamental theorem of algebra</b> pretty much states the following,
every non-zero, single-variable, polynomial of degree n has exactly n
roots even thought not all of them might be real (remember complex
roots).
</p>


<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
</p>


<p>
Given a non-constant polynomial p(z) with complex coefficients, the
polynomial q(z) = p(z)p(\hat{z}) has only real coefficients and, if z
is a zero of q(z), then either z or its conjugate is a root of p(z).
</p>

<p>
There is some positive real number R such that:
</p>

<p>
1/2&vert; z<sup>n</sup>&vert; &lt; 3/2&vert; z<sup>n</sup>&vert; when
&vert; z&vert; &gt; R.
</p>

excerpt: A short description of the fundamental theorem of algebra.
---

<p>
The <b>fundamental theorem of algebra</b> pretty much states the following,
every non-zero, single-variable, polynomial of degree n has exactly n
roots even thought not all of them might be real (remember complex
roots).
</p>

\begin{align}
   a &= b + x \\
   d &= a - b
\end{align}


<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
</p>


<p>
Given a non-constant polynomial p(z) with complex coefficients, the
polynomial q(z) = \[p(z)p(\hat{z})\] has only real coefficients and,
if z is a zero of q(z), then either z or its conjugate is a root of
p(z).
</p>

<p>
There is some positive real number R such that:
</p>

\begin{equation}
1/2\vert z^{n}\vert \lt 3/2\vert z^{n}\vert when
\vert z\vert > R.
\end{equation}

<p>
\frac{&delta; E<sub>x</sub>}{&delta; t} = \frac{\delta f(z-ct)}{\delta t} =
f<sup>&prime;</sup>(z - ct)\Big(\frac{\delta(z-ct)}{\delta t}\Big) =
-c*f<sup>&prime;</sup>(z - ct)
</p>

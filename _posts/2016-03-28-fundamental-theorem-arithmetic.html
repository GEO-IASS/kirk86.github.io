<p>
The <b>fundamental theorem of arithmetic</b> in number theory states that
every positive integer number greater than 1, \(x \in \mathbb{Z}\) where
\(x>1\) is a prime number or it is comprised of the unique product of
prime numbers up to the order of the factors.

&gt; Example
1200 = 2<sup>4x3</sup><sup>1x5</sup><sup>2</sup> = 3x2x2x2x2

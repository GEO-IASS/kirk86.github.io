<p>
The <b>fundamental theorem of arithmetic</b> in number theory states that
every positive integer number greater than 1, x &isin; <b>Z</b> where x &gt; 1,
is a prime number or it is comprised of the unique product of prime
numbers up to the order of the factors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b>
</p>

<p>
1250 = 2<sup>1</sup> &times; 5<sup>4</sup> = 2&times; 5&times; 5&times; 5&times; 5<br  />
1200 = 3<sup>1</sup>&times; 5<sup>2</sup>&times; 2<sup>4</sup> = 3&times; 5&times; 5&times; 2&times;
2&times; 2&times; 2<br  />
</p>

<p>
<b>In other words:</b>
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>1250 and 1200 can be represented as a product of primes</li>
<li>there will always be a specific amount of primes in each product</li>
</ol>


<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
</p>

<p>
Using <b>Euclid's lemma</b> and <b>B\`{e}zout's identity</b>. Let p be a
prime. Assume p divides the product of two integers a and b written as
(p|ab), and its negation is &not; (p|ab).
</p>

<p>
Then either p divides a (p|a) or p divides b (p|b) or both. Some
equivalent statements:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if &not; (p|a) and &not; (p|b), then &not; (p|ab).</li>
<li>if &not; (p|a) and (p|ab), then (p|b).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Generalization of <b>Euclid's lemma</b> from prime numbers to any integers:
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if (n|ab), and n shares no common divisors other than 1 with a, then
(n|b).</li>
</ul>

<p>
If n is prime, either:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(n|a) or</li>
<li>n shares no common divisors other than 1 (i.e. relatively prime)
with a, therefore, &not; (n|a) so (n|b).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, this is a generalization.
</p>


<p>
<b>B\'{e}zout's identity</b> states that if x and y are share no common
 divisor other than 1 (i.e. are relatively prime integers) there
 exist integers r and s such that:
</p>

<p>
rx + sy = 1.
</p>

<p>
Let a and b share no common divisor other than 1, and assume that
(n|ab). According to B\'{e}zout's identity there exist r and s which
provide:
</p>

<p>
rn + sa = 1.
</p>

<p>
Multiplying both sides by b:
</p>

<p>
rnb + sab = b.
</p>

<p>
rnb is divisible by n and sab is divisible by ab which in turn is also
divisible by n as we state above in our assumption.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, since we have shown that both terms in the addition of
rnb + sab are divisible by n then it must be true that their sum b, is
also divisible by n.
</p>

<p>
This is also a generalization to <b>Euclid's lemma</b> mentioned above.

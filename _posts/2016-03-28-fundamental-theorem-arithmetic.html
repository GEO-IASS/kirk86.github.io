<p>
The <b>fundamental theorem of arithmetic</b> in number theory states that
every positive integer number greater than 1, \(x \in \textbf{Z} where
x > 1\) is a prime number or it is comprised of the unique product of
prime numbers up to the order of the factors. \[x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}\]
circle.

<p>
1200 = 2<sup>4</sup> x 3<sup>1</sup> x 5<sup>2</sup> = 3x2x2x2x2

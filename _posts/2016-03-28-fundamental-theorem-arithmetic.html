excerpt: A short description of the fundamental theorem of algebra.
---

<p>
The <b>fundamental theorem of arithmetic</b> in number theory states that
every positive integer number greater than 1, x &isin; <b>Z</b> where x &gt; 1,
is a prime number or it is comprised of the unique product of prime
numbers up to the order of the factors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b>
</p>

<p>
1250 = 2<sup>1</sup> &times; 5<sup>4</sup> = 2&times; 5&times; 5&times; 5&times; 5<br  />
1200 = 3<sup>1</sup>&times; 5<sup>2</sup>&times; 2<sup>4</sup> = 3&times; 5&times; 5&times; 2&times;
2&times; 2&times; 2
</p>

<p>
In other words:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>1250 and 1200 can be represented as a product of primes</li>
<li>there will always be a specific amount of primes in each product</li>
</ol>

<p>
The <b>fundamental theorem of calculus</b> can be broken down into 2
different parts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>1st part: 1st fundamental theorem of calculus</b> states that if \(f\)
is <i>continuous</i> on the <i>closed interval</i> \([a, b]\) and \(F\) is the
<i>indefinite integral</i> of \(f\) on $[a, b],$ then \(\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx =
  F(b) - F(a)\)</li>
<li><b>2nd part: 2nd fundamental theorem of calculus</b></li>
</ul>

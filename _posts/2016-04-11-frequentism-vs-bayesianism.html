excerpt: Thoughts regarding the subtle differences between Frequentism and Bayesianism.
---

<p>
The disagreement between <b>Frequentism</b> and <b>Bayesianism</b> concerns the
definition of probability.
</p>

<p>
<b>Frequentism</b> interprets probability as the limiting case of repeated
measurements.
</p>

<p>
probabilites = fundamentally related frequency of any given value
</p>

<p>
<b>Bayesianism</b> interprets probability as degrees of certainty about
 statements.
</p>

<p>
probability = fundamentally related to our knowledge about an event
</p>

<p>
probability = statement of my knowledge of what the measurement result
will be
</p>

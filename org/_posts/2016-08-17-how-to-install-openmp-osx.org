The easiest way to install opemp support for llvm clang compilesrs on
a mac osx 10.11 el capitan is via homebrew. We will use clang-omp
package from homebrew. The only problem is that clang-omp has been
removed from official homebrew repositories. But that is not a big
problem, because we can install even removed packages. The only thing
that we need to know is where the package resides in the homebrew
directory structure. In our case it is located
```homebrew/boneyard/clang-omp```.

Let's install it:

`brew install homebrew/boneyard/clang-omp`

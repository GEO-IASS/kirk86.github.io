The *fundamental theorem of algebra* pretty much states the following,
every non-zero, single-variable, polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly
$n$ roots even thought not all of them might be real (remember complex
roots).

*Proof:*

Given a non-constant polynomial $p(z)$ with complex coefficients, the
polynomial $q(z) = p(z)p(\bar{z})$ has only real
coefficients and, if $z$ is a zero of $q(z)$, then
either $z$ or its conjugate is a root of $p(z)$.


There is some positive real number $\mathbb{R}$ such that:

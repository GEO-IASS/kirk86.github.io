The *fundamental theorem of calculus* can be broken down into 2
different parts:

- *1st part: 1st fundamental theorem of calculus* states that if $f$
  is /continuous/ on the /closed interval/ $[a, b]$ and $F$ is the
  /indefinite integral/ of $f$ on $[a, b],$ then $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx =
  F(b) - F(a)$
- *2nd part: 2nd fundamental theorem of calculus*

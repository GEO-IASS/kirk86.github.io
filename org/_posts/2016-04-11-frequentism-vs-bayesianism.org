excerpt: Thoughts regarding the subtle differences between Frequentism and Bayesianism.

#+END_HTML

The disagreement between *Frequentism* and *Bayesianism* concerns the
definition of probability.

*Frequentism* interprets probability as the limiting case of repeated
measurements.

probabilites = fundamentally related frequency of any given value

*Bayesianism* interprets probability as degrees of certainty about
 statements.

probability = fundamentally related to our knowledge about an event

probability = statement of my knowledge of what the measurement result
will be

*Example:* Given a measurements of a photon flux $F$ from a given star
 estimate the true flux of the star.

|--------------------------------+---+---+---+------------|
|                                |   |   |   | <10>       |
| *Frequentist view:*            |   |   |   | Since by definition the probability of the true flux of a star is a fixed value then it is meaningless for the frequentist to talk about the probability. Talking about frequency distribution for a fixed value is nonsense. |
| *Bayesian view:*               |   |   |   | Claims to measure the flux $F$ of a star with some probability $P(F)$. Although the probability can be estimated from frequencies of repeated experiments it is not fundamental. |
|                                |   |   |   | Can meaningfully talk about the probability that the true flux of a star lies in a given range |
|                                |   |   |   | Probability codifies our knowledge of the value based on prior information and/or available data |
| Philosophy difference leads to |   |   |   | different approaches to statistical analysis of data |


~An example illustrating the different approaches:~

_Notation:_

$N$ = measurements

$i^{th}$ = observation

$F_{i}$ = photon flux

$e_{i}$ = error related to $F_{i}$


Assumptions regarding $e_{i}$: $e_{i}\; \sim\; \cal{N}(\mu, \sigma^{2})$

*Frequentist:*

$e_{i} = \frac{\sigma}{std}$ of the results of a single measurement
event w.r.t. the limit of the repetitions of that event.

*Bayesian:*

$e_{i} = \frac{\sigma}{std}$ of (Gaussian) probability distribution
describing our knowledge of that particular measurement given its
observed value.

Given $D = \{F_{i}, e_{i}\}$ find the best estimate of the true
F_{true}?

Since $N \in \mathbb{N}$ thus a Poisson distribution is a good
approximation to the measurement process.

$F \;\sim\; \text{Pois}(\lambda_{i}), i = 1,\dots,n$
$F \;\sim\; \text{Pois}(\lambda)$

$\{N_{i}, e_{i}\}$ is estimated from Poisson statistics using the
standard square-root rule.

The true $F_{true}$ flux is already known: $F_{true} = 1000$, numbers
of photons measured in 1 sec.


1. *Frequentist approach:*

Start classic maximum likelihood!  Given $D_{i} = \{F_{i}, e_{i}\}$,
compute teh probability distribution of teh measurement given the true
$F_{true}$ flux, given also the assumption of Gaussian errors.

$$P(D_{i} | F_{true}) =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi e^{2}_{i}}}\text{exp}[-\frac{(F_{i} -
F_{true})^{2}}{2e^{2}_{i}}]$$

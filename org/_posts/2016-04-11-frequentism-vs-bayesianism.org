The disagreement between *Frequentism* and *Bayesianism* concerns the
definition of probability.

*Frequentism* interprets probability as the limiting case of repeated
measurements.

probabilites = fundamentally related frequency of any given value

*Bayesianism* interprets probability as degrees of certainty about
 statements.

probability = fundamentally related to our knowledge about an event

probability = statement of my knowledge of what the measurement result
will be

*Example:* Given a measurements of a photon flux $F$ from a given star
 estimate the true flux of the star.
